#🌍 Energy Consumption Analysis

# 📌 Project Overview
This project analyzes global energy consumption trends using a dataset containing:

Year

Country

Energy Consumption (kWh)

Renewable Energy Percentage (%)

CO2 Emissions (tons)

Day

The main goal is to identify energy usage patterns, renewable adoption, and the relationship between consumption and emissions.

# 🛠 Technology Stack
Python 🐍

Pandas → Data cleaning & processing

Matplotlib / Seaborn → Data visualization

Jupyter Notebook → Analysis environment

# 📊 Key Visualizations
Energy Consumption Over Days → Line plot of daily energy use.

Renewable Energy % by Country → Bar chart comparison of renewable adoption.

CO2 Emissions vs Energy Consumption → Scatter plot showing correlation.

Average Energy Consumption per Country → Bar chart of average usage.

Trend Over Years → Line chart of energy consumption trends per country.

# 🎯 Insights & Findings
Countries with higher renewable percentages show lower CO2 emissions.

Daily consumption shows clear fluctuations, highlighting peak usage days.

A positive correlation exists between energy consumption and emissions.


# 📌 Conclusion
Renewable energy adoption is increasing but still not sufficient to offset rising energy demand.

Some countries are leading in renewables while others remain heavily dependent on fossil fuels.

The project provides a foundation for energy policy insights and future sustainability planning.

Some countries consistently consume above average energy compared to others.

📌 Surprising Finding: Despite high renewable adoption, some countries still show high CO2 emissions, indicating reliance on non-clean energy sources.
